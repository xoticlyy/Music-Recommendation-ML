# Project1
CS ML Project
Built a machine learning model in Python that predicts the genre of music a person is likely to listen to based on user data. The project involved loading and preprocessing a dataset, selecting relevant features, and training a supervised learning model using scikit-learn. Model performance was evaluated using a train-test split and accuracy metrics. This project demonstrated practical application of machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling using real-world data.
